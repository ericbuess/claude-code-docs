description: Behavioral differences and prompting patterns for Claude Opus 4.8, covering verbosity, effort calibration, tool use, subagents, and frontend defaults.
---

This guide covers the prompting patterns specific to Claude Opus 4.8. For the API changes involved in moving from Claude Opus 4.8 to the latest Opus model, see [Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.8](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide#migrating-from-claude-opus-4-8-to-claude-opus-5). For techniques that apply across all current Claude models, see [Prompting best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices).

Claude Opus 4.8 has particular strengths in long-horizon agentic work, knowledge work, vision, and memory tasks. It performs well out of the box on existing Claude Opus 4.7 prompts. The following patterns cover the behaviors that most often require tuning.

</Note>

## Response length and verbosity

Claude Opus 4.8 calibrates response length to how complex it judges the task to be, rather than defaulting to a fixed verbosity. This usually means shorter answers on simple lookups and much longer ones on open-ended analysis.

If your product depends on a certain style or verbosity of output, you may need to tune your prompts. As an example, to decrease verbosity, you might add:

```text wrap
Provide concise, focused responses. Skip non-essential context, and keep examples minimal.
```

If you see specific examples of kinds of verbosity (such as over-explaining), you can add additional instructions in your prompt to prevent them. Positive examples showing how Claude can communicate with the appropriate level of concision tend to be more effective than negative examples or instructions that tell the model what not to do.

## Calibrating effort and thinking depth

The [effort parameter](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) allows you to tune Claude's intelligence versus token spend, trading off capability for faster speed and lower costs. Start with the `xhigh` effort level for coding and agentic use cases, and use a minimum of `high` effort for most intelligence-sensitive use cases. Experiment with other effort levels to further tune token usage and intelligence:

* **`max`:** Max effort can deliver performance gains in some use cases, but may show diminishing returns from increased token usage. This setting can also sometimes be prone to overthinking. Test max effort for intelligence-demanding tasks.
* **`xhigh`:** Extra high effort is the best setting for most coding and agentic use cases.
* **`high`:** This setting balances token usage and intelligence. For most intelligence-sensitive use cases, use a minimum of `high` effort.
* **`medium`:** Good for cost-sensitive use cases that need to reduce token usage while trading off intelligence.
* **`low`:** Reserve for short, scoped tasks and latency-sensitive workloads that are not intelligence-sensitive.

Claude Opus 4.8 respects effort levels strictly, especially at the low end. At `low` and `medium`, the model scopes its work to what was asked rather than going above and beyond. This is good for latency and cost, but on moderately complex tasks running at `low` effort there is some risk of under-thinking.

If you observe shallow reasoning on complex problems, raise effort to `high` or `xhigh` rather than prompting around it. If you need to keep effort at `low` for latency, add targeted guidance:

```text wrap
This task involves multistep reasoning. Think carefully through the problem before responding.
```

Effort is likely to be more important for this model than for any prior Opus, so experiment with it actively when you upgrade.

On Claude Opus 4.8, thinking is off unless you explicitly set `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. The triggering behavior for [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) is steerable. If you find the model thinking more often than you'd like, which can happen with large or complex system prompts, add guidance to steer it. As always, measure the effect of any prompting changes on performance. Example:

```text wrap
Thinking adds latency and should only be used when it will meaningfully improve answer quality — typically for problems that require multistep reasoning. When in doubt, respond directly.
```

Conversely, if you're running hard workloads at `medium` and seeing under-thinking, the first lever is to raise effort. If you need finer control, prompt for it directly.

<Note>
  If you are running Claude Opus 4.8 at `max` or `xhigh` effort, set a large max output token budget so the model has room to think and act across its subagents and tool calls. Start at 64k tokens and tune from there.
</Note>

## Tool use triggering

Claude Opus 4.8 has a tendency to favor reasoning over tool calls. This produces better results in most cases. However, increasing the effort setting is a useful lever to increase the level of tool usage, especially in knowledge work. `high` or `xhigh` effort settings show substantially more tool usage in agentic search and coding. For scenarios where you want more tool use, you can also adjust your prompt to explicitly instruct the model about when and how to properly use its tools. For instance, if you find that the model is not using your web search tools, clearly describe why and how it should.

## User-facing progress updates

Claude Opus 4.8 provides more regular, higher-quality updates to the user throughout long agentic traces. If you've added scaffolding to force interim status messages ("After every 3 tool calls, summarize progress"), try removing it. If you find that the length or contents of Claude Opus 4.8's user-facing updates are not well-calibrated to your use case, explicitly describe what these updates should look like in the prompt and provide examples.

## More literal instruction following

Claude Opus 4.8 interprets prompts literally and explicitly, particularly at lower effort levels. It does not silently generalize an instruction from one item to another, and it does not infer requests you didn't make. The upside of this literalism is precision and less thrash, and it generally performs better for API use cases with carefully tuned prompts, structured extraction, and pipelines where you want predictable behavior. If you need Claude to apply an instruction broadly, state the scope explicitly (for example, "Apply this formatting to every section, not just the first one").

## Tone and writing style

As with any new model, prose style on long-form writing may shift. Claude Opus 4.8 tends toward a direct, opinionated style with minimal validation-forward phrasing and sparing emoji use. If your product relies on a specific voice, re-evaluate style prompts against the new baseline.

For instance, if your product voice is warmer or more conversational, add:

```text wrap
Use a warm, collaborative tone. Acknowledge the user's framing before answering.
```

## Controlling subagent spawning

Claude Opus 4.8 tends to spawn fewer subagents by default. However, this behavior is steerable through prompting; give Claude Opus 4.8 explicit guidance around when subagents are desirable. A toy example for a coding use case:

```text wrap
Do not spawn a subagent for work you can complete directly in a single response (e.g. refactoring a function you can already see).

Spawn multiple subagents in the same turn when fanning out across items or reading multiple files.
```

## Design and frontend defaults

Claude Opus 4.8 has strong design instincts, with a consistent default house style: warm cream/off-white backgrounds (\~`#F4F1EA`), serif display type (Georgia, Fraunces, Playfair), italic word-accents, and a terracotta/amber accent. This reads well for editorial, hospitality, and portfolio briefs, but will feel off for dashboards, dev tools, fintech, healthcare, or enterprise apps. The default appears in slide decks and web UIs.

This default is persistent. Generic instructions ("don't use cream," "make it clean and minimal") tend to shift the model to a different fixed palette rather than producing variety. Two approaches work reliably:

**1. Specify a concrete alternative.** The model follows explicit specs precisely:

```text wrap
Design a desktop landing page for a supplement brand called AEFRM.

The visual direction should come from a cold monochrome atmosphere using pale silver-gray tones that gradually deepen into blue-gray and near-black, similar to a misted metallic surface.

The page should feel sharp and controlled, with a strong sense of structure and restraint.

Use this tonal system across the full page instead of introducing bright accent colors.

Use the uploaded image on the hero design in black and white.

The layout should be built with clear horizontal sections and a centered max-width container. Use 4px corner radius consistently across cards, buttons, inputs, and media frames. Margins should feel generous, with enough empty space around each section so the page breathes.

Typography should use a square, angular sans-serif with wider letter spacing than usual, especially in headings and navigation, so the text feels more engineered and less compressed. Headline text can be large and uppercase, while supporting copy remains short and sparse. The sub texts should be written with Alumni Sans SC in 4-6px like tiny little texts on corners bottom centre like that.

For the structure, start with a hero section containing a strong product statement, one short supporting paragraph, and a clean product placeholder or packshot frame. Below that, add a benefit grid with three or four blocks, then a formulation or ingredients section, and finally a cta.

Buttons should be flat and precise, with subtle hover changes using transition: all 160ms ease out where brightness and border contrast shift slightly rather than using dramatic motion.

Color palette should stay within this range:
#E9ECEC, #C9D2D4, #8C9A9E, #44545B, #11171B.
```

**2. Have the model propose options before building.** This breaks the default and gives users control. If you previously relied on `temperature` for design variety, use this approach; it produces meaningfully different directions across runs. Example prompt:

```text wrap
Before building, propose 4 distinct visual directions tailored to this brief (each as: bg hex / accent hex / typeface — one-line rationale). Ask the user to pick one, then implement only that direction.
```

Additionally, Claude Opus 4.8 requires less frontend design prompting than previous models to avoid generic patterns that users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. With earlier models, Anthropic recommended a lengthier prompt snippet in the [frontend-design skill](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md). However, Claude Opus 4.8 generates distinctive, creative frontends with more minimal prompting guidance. This prompt snippet works well with the preceding prompting advice for variety:

```text wrap
<frontend_aesthetics>
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white or dark backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character. Use unique fonts, cohesive colors and themes, and animations for effects and micro-interactions.
</frontend_aesthetics>
```

## Interactive coding products

Claude Opus 4.8's token usage and behavior can differ between autonomous, asynchronous coding agents with a single user turn and interactive, synchronous coding agents with multiple user turns. Specifically, it tends to use more tokens in interactive settings, primarily because it reasons more after user turns. This can improve long-horizon coherence, instruction following, and coding capabilities in long, interactive coding sessions, but also comes with more token usage. To maximize both performance and token efficiency in coding products, use `xhigh` or `high` effort, add autonomous features like an auto mode, and reduce the number of human interactions required from your users.

Of course, when limiting the number of required user interactions, it's important to specify the task, intent, and relevant constraints upfront in the first human turn. Providing well-specified, clear, and accurate task descriptions upfront can help maximize autonomy and intelligence while minimizing extra token usage after user turns. Because Claude Opus 4.8 is more autonomous than prior models, this usage pattern helps to maximize performance. In contrast, ambiguous or underspecified prompts conveyed progressively over multiple user turns tend to relatively reduce token efficiency and sometimes performance.

## Code review harnesses

Claude Opus 4.8 is meaningfully better at finding bugs than prior models, and has both higher recall and precision in internal evals. However, if your code-review harness was tuned for an earlier model, you may initially see lower recall. This is likely a harness effect, not a capability regression. When a review prompt says things like "only report high-severity issues," "be conservative," or "don't nitpick," Claude Opus 4.8 may follow that instruction more faithfully than earlier models did: it may investigate the code just as thoroughly, identify the bugs, and then not report findings it judges to be below your stated bar. This can show up as the model doing the same depth of investigation but converting fewer investigations into reported findings, especially on lower-severity bugs. Precision typically rises, but measured recall can fall even though the model's underlying bug-finding ability has improved.

Some recommended prompt language:

```text wrap
Report every issue you find, including ones you are uncertain about or consider low-severity. Do not filter for importance or confidence at this stage - a separate verification step will do that. Your goal here is coverage: it is better to surface a finding that later gets filtered out than to silently drop a real bug. For each finding, include your confidence level and an estimated severity so a downstream filter can rank them.
```

This prompt can be used without having an actual second step, but moving confidence filtering out of the finding step often helps. If your harness has a separate verification, deduplication, or ranking stage, tell the model explicitly that its job at the finding stage is coverage rather than filtering.

If you do want the model to self-filter in a single pass, be concrete about where the bar is rather than using qualitative terms like "important": for example, "report any bugs that could cause incorrect behavior, a test failure, or a misleading result; only omit nits like pure style or naming preferences."

Iterate on prompts against a subset of your evals or test cases to validate recall or F1 score gains.

## Computer use

On the Claude API, Claude Opus 4.8 supports the `computer_toolset_20260801` toolset and the earlier `computer_20251124` tool version. For tasks inside webpages, Claude Opus 4.8 also supports the [browser use tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/browser-use-tool) (`browser_toolset_20260801`). [Computer use](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool) capability works across resolutions, up to a maximum resolution of 2576px / 3.75MP. Internal computer use testing shows that sending images at 1080p provides a good balance of performance and cost.

For particularly cost-sensitive workloads, 720p or 1366×768 are lower-cost options with strong performance. Conduct your own testing to find the ideal settings for your use case; experimenting with effort settings can also help tune the model's behavior.
